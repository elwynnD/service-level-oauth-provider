# Oauth provider - service level

## What we will cover

* What is Oauth?
* When do we want to use a service level oauth system?
* How can we create our own service level oauth system?

## Notes

Oauth is a validation standard that has gotten popular in recent time and it is used
most commonly to provide a third party system with access to resources held by another
system.

An example of this is the Google API, if you want the data Google has for your own system
it is through using Oauth you will get it.
